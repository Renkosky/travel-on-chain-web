## Composable NFTs

From the start we've known NFTs needed to have more utility than just being JPEGs, thus we aim to start with building composable NFTs to enrich the ecosystem of the NFT community. By combining different basic NFT components, users can freely assemble new NFTs with higher value. We believe this will bring new interactive experiences and pave the way for broader applications, particularly in the realm of blockchain gaming in the future.
